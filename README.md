# product-page
Project from freeCodeCamp product-landing-page, tried to make it as best as I could, should be pretty responsive

First time using videos and sometimes sizing the content can be a bit messy for me, but eventually I'll start to understand it more and make code with less redudant inputs(I don't know if this one has any, but still)
